        We all know how DLSU's tech is at the moment. Old, outdated, hard to handle.<br/>
        This project aims to morph My.LaSalle to be made in our way.<br/>
        <br/>
        The project is currently WIP, at around 65% progress.<br/> The screenshot below is an example.
        of what has been worked on so far.<br/> We are currently doing testing on the bot on the DLSU ID 123 discord server.
